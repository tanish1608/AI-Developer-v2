This API route handles the following operations:

GET /api/todos: Returns a list of all todos. If an ID is provided as a query parameter, returns the todo with that ID.
POST /api/todos: Creates a new todo. Returns the new todo.
PUT /api/todos/:id: Updates a specific todo. Returns the updated todo.
DELETE /api/todos/:id: Deletes a specific todo.

Note: This is a basic implementation and does not include any type of data validation, error handling, or security measures. In a real-world application, you would want to add these features.
